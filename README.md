Editable text files for configuring various programs on *nix systems.

I've been using [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) for quite some years and have decided to finally have my configs out there.

My setup is pretty minimal and it comes with an installer sitting in `install.sh`. It's not perfect, but it takes care of the packages I use.

Personal forks of [Suckless Utilities](https://suckless.org/) can be found in the following repositories:
